        <h2>Regular savings accounts</h2>

        <p>A regular savings account is an account whereby interest in compounded monthly and released on account
            maturity. Regular savers take one year to mature from the initial deposit date.
            A regular savings account pays anything from 1% to 6% (AER), you need to meet the monthly minimum deposit to
            validate the account, this minimum is varied from bank to bank, they also have a maximum.
            Due to this fact most people set up a standing order for 12 months.</p>

        <p>Because on the maximum deposit most people will, if they can afford it, set up many regular savings accounts
            with different banks, that's where our system comes in handy, you can track your grand total balance, keep a
            eye on how long till the account matures and how much interest would have accumulated at the current
            time.</p>

        <p>When you add an account with us all you need to do is add an account name, interest rate, monthly deposit and
            the first deposit date, we do all the maths for you, how good is that !</p>
